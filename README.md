# Code Quiz
_A coding assessment App_

## Overview
Front-end web development is a craft that requires you to challenge yourself daily. Whether it’s a job interview, a new project, honing your skills to perform beyond the expectations of your client is the way to go. In this task, I am recreating a typical coding assessment platform that is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding Challenges. 
This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## Description
This is a simplified version of a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions, the timer starts once you click the button and your have 60seconds to complete the test. If you get a question wrong, 10 seconds is chopped of your time and the session ends if the time finishes before you complete. The summary page which follows, displays your score and text box to enter your initial so your score can be stored. Click [**here.**](https://rhanciles.github.io/Code-Quiz/) to begin.
  
## Mock-Up
![The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:](./assets/images/08-web-apis-challenge-demo.gif).

Press the button to start quiz and click to select your answer to each question. Alerts at the bottom displays if your answer was correct or incorrect and takes 10 seconds of your time if it’s the latter. The quiz finishes when you complete the questions or run out of time.

## Usage
This Repo is made up of the core files and folders related to the task. I have added comments to all the relevant sections of the code, highlighting key areas and the expected result derived from it. The content comprise only that related to the task and I have kept the interface very simple and straight forward to use. It also contains a folder with an animated image of the mock-up depicting the final product. Simply click on the button to start, and follow the prompts, it’s that easy.
